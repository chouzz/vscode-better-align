# Personal Code of Conduct

## My Pledge

I, as the project owner and contributor, pledge to make participation in my personal projects a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

I will act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy environment.

## My Standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to a positive environment include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward others
- Respecting differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Taking responsibility and apologizing when I make mistakes, and learning from them
- Focusing on what is best not just for myself, but for the community around these projects

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Using sexualized language or imagery, or making sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others’ private information (e.g., physical or email addresses) without explicit permission
- Any other conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional or community setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

I am responsible for clarifying and enforcing these standards of acceptable behavior. I will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that I deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

I have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, or other contributions that do not align with this Code of Conduct. When I moderate, I will communicate reasons for my decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies everywhere I host or represent these personal projects, both in community spaces (e.g., GitHub repositories, discussion threads) and in any public settings where I represent the project (e.g., social media, conferences, meetups).

## Reporting and Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior can be reported to me directly at [sinanbolel.com](https://sinanbolel.com) using the chat feature. I will review and investigate all reports promptly and fairly. I will respect the privacy and security of anyone who reports incidents.

## Enforcement Guidelines

When determining consequences for any action I deem in violation of this Code of Conduct, I will follow these guidelines:

### 1. Correction

**Behavior Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from me, providing clarity around why the behavior was inappropriate. I may request a public apology.

### 2. Warning

**Behavior Impact**: A violation through a single incident or a series of actions.

**Consequence**: A formal warning outlining consequences for continued behavior. The individual may be asked to avoid interacting with certain project spaces (including issue threads, pull requests, discussion forums, and external channels like social media) for a specified period. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Behavior Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any interaction or communication within these projects for a defined period. No public or private interactions with contributors or maintainers are allowed during this time. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Behavior Impact**: A pattern of violations, including sustained inappropriate behavior, targeted harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of groups.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from all public interactions within my personal projects.
